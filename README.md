This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to recursive functions and reference passing. The `processData` function aims to recursively process an array, splitting string values containing commas into arrays. However, the way references are handled leads to an unexpected modification of the original array.  The `bug.php` file shows the buggy code and its unexpected output. The `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version. This example highlights the importance of understanding PHP's reference behavior when working with recursive functions.
